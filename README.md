Smart Farm AI

Smart Farm AI is a web-based prototype designed to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can support farmers by providing clear, region-specific farming advice through a simple and accessible interface. The application has been developed as part of Formative Assessment–2 (FA-2) for the Generative AI course and builds upon the research, planning, and ideation completed in FA-1.

The primary goal of Smart Farm AI is to assist farmers in making better decisions related to crop selection, pest control, water management, soil health, and weather-based planning. Instead of overwhelming users with excessive choices or complex technical settings, the application focuses on delivering concise, actionable suggestions that are easy to understand and apply in real-world farming scenarios.

The app allows users to select a geographic region and a specific type of farming query, such as crop recommendation or pest management. Based on these inputs, the system provides tailored advice relevant to the selected location. This approach ensures that the outputs are context-aware rather than generic, helping farmers receive guidance that aligns with local climate, soil conditions, and common agricultural practices.

Smart Farm AI is intentionally designed as a powerful yet limited application. While artificial intelligence systems are capable of handling a wide range of inputs and generating highly detailed responses, real-world constraints such as computational resources, data availability, and deployment environments must be considered. To reflect these practical limitations, the app offers a controlled set of regions and question types rather than unrestricted user inputs. This design choice improves reliability, reduces the risk of incorrect or misleading advice, and ensures that the system remains efficient and stable when deployed.

The app also includes basic multilingual interface support to improve accessibility for users from different regions. This ensures that essential information can be understood more easily by a wider audience. The multilingual support is intentionally limited to maintain clarity and reliability.It includes languages like, Hindi, English, Punjabi and Marathi. 

The limited number of options also mirrors real-world AI deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as rural or agricultural settings, where internet access, device capabilities, and processing power may be restricted. By narrowing the scope, Smart Farm AI prioritizes usability and trust over excessive functionality. Farmers can quickly navigate the app, understand the recommendations, and act on them without confusion or technical barriers.

In addition to textual advice, the application includes basic data visualizations that represent factors such as water usage, cost, risk, and sustainability. These visual elements help users better understand the broader impact of farming decisions and introduce the concept of data-driven agriculture in an intuitive way.

Smart Farm AI is built using Python and Streamlit and is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy global access. While the current version uses predefined logic to simulate AI-driven recommendations, the structure of the app allows for future integration with large language models such as Google Gemini. This makes the project a strong foundation for further development in subsequent assessments.

Overall, Smart Farm AI demonstrates how generative AI concepts can be applied responsibly and practically in agriculture, balancing capability with limitation, and innovation with real-world feasibility.
